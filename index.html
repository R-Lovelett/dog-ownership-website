<h1 id="main">Owning a Dog & Dog Care</h1>

<p>A dog can be a wonderful addition to any home, and no matter if you're an experienced 
pet owner or first-time owner, it's important to take good care of your canine companion. 
In order to help ensure your dog is receiving the amount of care they need, here are some 
tips for all dog owners.</p>

<p>If you don't already own a dog, and are considering adding one to the family, please 
make adoption your first option. There are so many dogs in animal shelters across the country 
that are just looking for loving, caring homes. Visit

to start your search.</p>

<h2>Feeding</h2>

	<ul>
	  <li>Puppies eight to 12 weeks old need four meals a day.</li>
	  <li>Feed puppies three to six months old three meals a day.</li>
	  <li>Feed puppies six months to one year two meals a day.</li>
	  <li>When your dog reaches his first birthday, one meal a day is usually enough.</li>
	  <li>For some dogs, including larger canines or those prone to bloat, it's better to feed two smaller meals.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Premium-quality dry food provides a well-balanced diet for adult dogs and may be 
	mixed with water, broth or canned food. Your dog may enjoy cottage cheese, cooked 
	egg or fruits and vegetables, but these additions should not total more than ten percent 
	of his daily food intake.</p>

	<p>Puppies should be fed a high-quality, brand-name puppy food (large breed puppy 
	foods for large breeds). Please limit "people food," however, because it can result 
	in vitamin and mineral imbalances, bone and teeth problems and may cause very picky 
	eating habits and obesity. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times, and 
	be sure to wash food and water dishes frequently.</p>
	
<h2>Exercise</h2>
	<p>Dogs need exercise to burn calories, stimulate their minds, and stay healthy. 
	Individual exercise needs vary based on breed or breed mix, sex, age and level of 
	health. Exercise also tends to help dogs avoid boredom, which can lead to 
	destructive behaviors. Supervised fun and games will satisfy many of your pet's 
	instinctual urges to dig, herd, chew, retrieve and chase.</p>

<h2>Grooming</h2>
	<p>Help keep your dog clean and reduce shedding with frequent brushing. 
	Check for fleas and ticks daily during warm weather. Most dogs don't need 
	to be bathed more than a few times a year. Before bathing, comb or cut out 
	all mats from the coat. Carefully rinse all soap out of the coat, or the dirt 
	will stick to soap residue. For more detailed information on grooming your dog, visit 
	<a href = "https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-grooming-tips">ASPCA's grooming tips</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Handling</h2>
	<p>To carry a puppy or small dog, place one hand under the dog's chest, 
	with either your forearm or other hand supporting the hind legs and rump. 
	Never attempt to lift or grab your puppy or small dog by the forelegs, tail 
	or back of the neck. If you do have to lift a large dog, lift from the 
	underside, supporting his chest with one arm and his rear end with the other.</p>
	
<h2>Housing</h2>
	<p>Your pet needs a warm, quiet place to rest, away from all drafts and off 
	the floor. A training crate or dog bed is ideal, with a clean blanket or pillow 
	placed inside. Wash the dog's bedding often. If your dog will be spending a lot 
	of time outdoors, be sure she has access to shade and plenty of cool water in hot 
	weather, and a warm, dry, covered shelter when it's cold.</p>

<h2>Licensing & Identification</h2>
	<p>Follow your community’s licensing regulations. Be sure to attach the license 
	to your dog’s collar. This, along with an ID tag and implanted microchip or tattoo, 
	can help secure your dog’s return should she become lost.</p>

<h2>Health</h2>

	<div id="indent">
	<h3>Fleas & Ticks</h3>
		<p>Daily inspections of your dog for fleas and ticks during the warm seasons are 
		important. Use a flea comb to find and remove fleas. There are several new methods 
		of flea and tick control. Speak to your veterinarian about these and other options.</p>
		
	<h3>Medicines & Poisons</h3>
		<p>Never give your dog medication that has not been prescribed by a veterinarian. 
		<u>If you suspect that your animal has ingested a poisonous substance, call your 
		veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center for 24-hour animal poison 
		information at (888)-426-4435.</u></p>
		
	<h3>Spaying & Neutering</h3>
		<p>Female dogs should be spayed and male dogs neutered by six months of age. Visit 
		<a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/spayneuter-your-pet">ASPCA's Spay/Neuter Information page</a> 
		to learn more about the benefits of spaying/neutering your pet.</p>
		
	<h3>Vaccinations</h3>
		<p>Your dog may benefit from receiving a number of vaccinations. Please visit 
		<a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/vaccinations-your-pet">ASPCA's Pet Vaccinations page</a> to learn 
		more about which vaccinations your pet might need.</p>

<h2>Dog Supplies (Checklist)</h2>
	<p>Taking care of a dog is a fun experience that requires a lot of supplies 
	to ensure they are happy and healthy. Here is a small checklist of things 
	all dog owners need to ensure their pet is well taken care of: </p>
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Premium-quality dog food and treats</li>
	  <li>Food dish</li>
	  <li>Water bowl</li>
	  <li>Toys, toys and more toys, including safe chew toys</li>
	  <li>Brush & comb for grooming, including flea comb</li>
	  <li>Collar with license and ID tag</li>
	  <li>Leash</li>
	  <li>Dog carrier (for smaller dogs)</li>
	  <li>Training crate/Dog kennel</li>
	  <li>Dog bed or box with warm blanket</li>
	  <li>Dog toothbrush &  toothpaste</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Dog Age</h2>

	<p>Depending on the size of the dog you own, or are looking to get, your dog will age differently than 
	dogs of other sizes. Breed plays a major role as well: some dog breeds are more susceptable to disaeses 
	that my shorten their life-span, although these can be treated with the help of a veterinarian.</p>
	
	<p>The general rule of thumb is that smaller dogs tend to live longer than larger ones. A large 
	pup might age more slowly for the first few years of life, but be nearing middle-age at 5. Tiny 
	and toy breeds aren't considered "seniors" until around the age of 10. And medium-sized dogs lay in 
	the middle of aging speeds.</p>
	
	<p>Do not worry though, the age of a dog is not set in stone! A dog's life can be extended with proper care: 
	things such as a healthy diet, plenty of exercise, and regular vet visits help ensure your pet is as healthy 
	as they can possibly be!</p>
